![fafl102]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/bookImage.jpg)

The [CAIRIS documentation](https://cairis.readthedocs.io) explains how to use CAIRIS, but it doesn't explain how usable and secure software should be designed.

[Designing Usable and Secure Software with IRIS and CAIRIS](https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319754925) explains how CAIRIS can be used as part of the IRIS framework to design usable and secure software.  The book explains the framework, describes how CAIRIS supports it, and provides real case studies where IRIS and CAIRIS have been used to build and apply personas, specify systems, and design and analyse software architectures.
