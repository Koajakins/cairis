We're pleased to announce new features to CAIRIS to help designers not only build security in, but also privacy as well.

For some time now, CAIRIS has supported the automatic generation of visual models, and provided some measure of model validation, e.g. [generating security and usability scores based on risks and tasks](https://cairis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/risks.html#risk-analysis-model), [evaluating the probability of obstacles](https://cairis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gro.html#obstacle-modelling), and [visualising requirements quality using Chernoff Faces](https://cairis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gro.html#visualising-requirements-quality-using-chernoff-faces).  Until now, CAIRIS hasn't explicitly supported validation across an entire model, but -- with the arrival of CAIRIS 1.6.0 -- we have started supporting explicit model validation.  

This feature is described in more detail in the [documentation](https://cairis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validation.html), and although only a limited amount of validation checks are supported so far, there will be more to come in the coming weeks and months.

As part of our use of CAIRIS to support [a GDPR implementation we are running with a local charity](https://cybersecurity.bournemouth.ac.uk/?p=641), we have now started incorporating model validation checks for GDPR compliance into CAIRIS.  To do this, we have introduce [three new types of role to CAIRIS (Data Controller, Data Processor, and Data Subject)](https://cairis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/roles_personas.html#roles), and [steps for introducing personal data into a CAIRIS model](https://cairis.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dependencies.html#introducing-personal-data-into-cairis-using-dependencies).

Once these steps have been completed then, if personal data access and their processing is integrated into your model, then the model validation checks can evaluate any potential breaches to the [GDPR principles](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-the-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr/principles/).

At the moment, only validation against the principle of Lawfulness, Fairness, and Transparency is supported, but more checks are coming soon.

We hope these new features are useful.  If you get any problems, or have requests for other model validation checks -- be these related to GDPR or not -- then please [raise an issue](https://github.com/failys/cairis/issues).
